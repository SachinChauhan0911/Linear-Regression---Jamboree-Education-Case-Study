**Predicting Graduate Admissions Probability Using Linear Regression**
This repository contains a case study project to predict the probability of students getting admitted into a graduate program at XYZ League College based on various factors such as CGPA, GRE score, TOEFL score, and more. The goal of this project is to use Linear Regression to estimate the Chance_of_Admit for prospective students.

Problem Statement
Jamboree has helped thousands of students reach top colleges abroad by providing test prep services for GMAT, GRE, SAT, etc. As part of their service, they have introduced a feature on their website that allows students to check their probability of admission into the XYZ League College. The feature uses data like:

GRE Score
TOEFL Score
University Rating
SOP (Statement of Purpose)
LOR (Letter of Recommendation Strength)
CGPA
Research Experience
The aim is to create a predictive model using linear regression that estimates a student’s Chance_of_Admit using these independent variables.

Features Used for Prediction
The features used in this analysis are:

GRE Score: Graduate Record Exam score (out of 340)
TOEFL Score: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (out of 120)
University Rating: Rating of the University (1-5 scale)
SOP: Strength of Statement of Purpose (1-5 scale)
LOR: Strength of Letter of Recommendation (1-5 scale)
CGPA: Undergraduate GPA (on a scale of 10)
Research: Whether the student has research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Chance_of_Admit: The target variable, i.e., the probability of getting admitted (between 0 and 1)
Approach
The project follows these main steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset
Handle any missing data
Standardize or normalize the features for better performance in regression models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the distributions of the features
Checking the correlations between the independent features and the target variable (Chance_of_Admit).
Model Development:

Implement Linear Regression to predict Chance_of_Admit using the independent variables.
Perform Ridge and Lasso regularization to prevent overfitting and enhance feature selection.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared (R²) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Use cross-validation to generalize model performance on unseen data.
